## Introduction

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems consist of three components: _tags_ also known as labels or transponders [2], _readers_ also known as interrogators [2] and a back-end server [1]. RFID systems are used to track tags attached to objects through space and time and have thus found applications in a wide range of fields [3].

## Configuration

### Raspberry Pi 4B

A Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4b) with Rapsbian installed was used.

#### Pin Diagram

The pin diagram of the RPi4b can be generated by running the command `gpio readall`.

    $ gpio readall

The following section explains the significance of each module followed by the correspondig PIN environment variable configurations.

### RC522

A RC522 `13.56MHz` RFID module is used as an access terminal reader and admin console writer.

### DHT11

Temperature and humidity module to show both the temperature and humidity of the room one is trying to enter.

    DHT11_PIN=11

### LED

Used to signify the door is unlocked.

    LED_PIN=5

### 8X8 Matrix Keypad

Used to input TAN keys.

    DHT11_PIN=11

### SG90 Servo

Simulates a mechanical door.

    SERVO_PIN=18

## Limitations

1. Relies on 13MHz MiFare cards which are inherently secure.

2. Centralised server is a single point of failure. A server going down means the whole system goes down. A decentralised system where terminals can also act as servers might come into question, however this approach raises a lot of security questions.

3. Energy could be saved by using an ultrasound sensor at the reader terminal through activating the `RC522` module by sending a signal to the currently unused `IRQ` connection only when an actor approaches and putting the RFID module into sleep mode otherwise.
