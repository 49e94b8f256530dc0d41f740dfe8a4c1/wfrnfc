## Introduction

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems consist of three components: *tags* also known as labels or transponders [2], *readers* also known as interrogators [2] and a back-end server [1]. RFID systems are used to track tags attached to objects through space and time and have thus found applications in a wide range of fields [3].

## Hardware Setup

### Raspberry Pi 4B

A Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4b) with Rapsbian installed was used for this project.

#### Pin Diagram

The pin diagram of the RPi4b can be generated by running the command `gpio readall`.

    $ gpio readall

### RC522

A RC522 `13.56MHz` RFID module is used as the receiver. This module is based on the MFRC522 IC (integrated circuit) released by NXP Semiconductors. The RPi4b and RC522 communicate using a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). The RC522 module is wired up with the help of the RPi4b [pin diagram](#output) above.
